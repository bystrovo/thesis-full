[TODO:] Describe Valence and Arousal evaluation techniques

SAM, AS

Due to effort constraints of the participants it is important to achieve a cheap, yet accurate reading of their emotions. In the context of this study self-evaluation is a means to validate results rather than being the central part of the study. Therefore I chose to rely on the SAM (Self-Assessment Manikin) method \cite{Bradley1994} to quickly assess emotions of participants at multiple stages of the experiment.
