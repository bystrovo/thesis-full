\section{Background}

	\subsection{Motivation}
	
	[TODO]
	
	\input{motivation.tex}
	
		
	\subsection{Research basis} 
	
	\cite{McCrudden2017} describe from a standpoint of information architecture the effect of different types of visual display on cognitive processing. They highlight the important aspects of visual guidelines, the basics of human working and long-term memory and a way to quantify those under processing efficiency.
	
	There is, however, a case to be made with respect to the same visual display presented to a participant under differentiating emotional conditions. There is strong evidence that emotions play a role in information processing and, as a consequence have an effect on the resulting performance
	
	\subsection{Hypotheses}
	
	\paragraph{Hypothesis 1.} Two different interfaces can result in a significant difference in emotional response
	\paragraph{Hypothesis 2.} Resulting performance (as measured by selected study design parameters) during the experiment is higher for saturated interface, compared to desaturated interface.

\section{Approach and Methods}

To facilitate the study I make assumptions about the medium in which e-learning is usually conducted. Based on the research basis I define study design parameters and a set of target variables that will be evaluated.

	\subsection{Medium}
	
	The study is to be conducted online under a "real-life" scenario. This means, that the experiment is to be run in a browser-capable web-application runnable on modern personal computers. Like most e-learning software the  application used in the study is browser-based and usually used in users homes or public places.
	
	\subsection{Study design}
	
	The goal of the current study is to determine emotional response to provided emotional design implementation (Interface 1) compared to the control group that was provided with a stricter desaturated design (Interface 0). The differences include use of color, shapes, language, font style, responsiveness, animation. The similarities and, thus constant variables, across both interfaces include any accessibility features and general usability heuristics, such as contrast ratio level, size and placement of elements on a screen, 
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item[0.] \textbf{Clustering:} Each participant is assigned an interface version (1 of 2) and the preconditioning group (1 of 4) at random before first load of the application.
		
		\item \textbf{Preconditioning:} Each participant is shown a set of emotional images and preconditioned to be in one of 4 states:
			\textbf{1}: Positive valence / high arousal;
			\textbf{2}: Negative valence / high arousal;
			\textbf{3}: Positive valence / low arousal;
			\textbf{4}: Negative valence / low arousal;
			
		Choice and showing of preconditioning is described further in in the following chapter \ref{preconditioning}
			
		\item \textbf{Emotional validation:} A short emotional self-reporting questionnaire (SAM \ref{'sec:selfeval'}) is used to validate, whether preconditioning has had sufficient and expected effect on the participant.
		
		\item \textbf{Experiment 1:} Slightly modified classic memory game. The participant is presented with a grid of tiles, each tile containing an image. During 5 seconds at the beginning of the experiment all tiles are open to allow to memorize the images. After which all images are hidden. Only 2 tiles can be opened at any one time. Once 2 of the same tiles are open they are marked as solved. The goal is to solve all tiles.
		
		\item \textbf{Experiment 2:} Remote Associates Test (RAT). A generalized creativity test developed by Mednick \cite{Mednick1962} in 1962. Each participant is presented with a number of word sets. Each set consists of 3 words that are shown to the participant and one target word that is hidden from the them. The target word is semantically connected to all 3 visible words
		
		\item \textbf{Emotional validation:} A second emotional self-reporting questionnaire (SAM \ref{'sec:selfeval'}) to establish, whether and which effect tasks and interface have had on the participant's emotion.
		
		\item \textbf{Demographic data:} Final step adds additional context data about the person for each participant through a questionnaire to complement data analysis.

		\subsubsection{Experiment 1: Short term Memory}
		
		Memory Experiment 
		
		[TODO:] Describe basis of the experiment
		
		[TODO:] describe activity logging for EXP1 here?
		
		[TODO:] measuring performance of this experiment
		
		\paragraph{Performance parameters:} \label{sec:memory-parameters}
		
		\subsubsection{Experiment 2: Creative thought}
		
		A generalized creativity test developed by Mednick \cite{Mednick1962} in 1962. It does not require prior knowledge of any particular subject. Some of 144 compound remote associate sets are taken from \cite{Bowden}. These are a subset of RAT problems and have been alternatively described as "compound word problems". Of the triad of words that are presented each can form a compound word or a two-word phrase with the solution word.

[TODO:] Here describe how evaluation was done, how many people participated, demographics data.

[TODO:] Show general statistical data

	\subsection{Hypothesis 1}:
